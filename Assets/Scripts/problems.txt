Conflicting Transitions on the CollectRessource State

Solution: 
First Idea was a default state which wasnt executed because the second Idea
was to prevent setting the old state over and over again, instead only make 
transitions to new states, which also seems to be more natural in the context 
of a dfa.

The Singleton Objects dont work for multiple Momos of course. So we have to
try and give every momo its own QLearner and Util Object.

Solution:
For now all the scripts are attached to the momos as MonoBehaviours

Sometimes the momos stay idle after reaching a ressource or the trade post.
Something must be wrong with choosing the actions

Solution:
In the Reset Function of the Explore action we set the foodTarget in the foodfinder
to null and thereby we prevent the collect action to get stuck in a loop

Sometimes the momos stay idle after reaching a ressource.
They end up in the trade acion. (Only happens to momos in state 3 or 4?)

Solution:
Need to reset something in the Trade action
